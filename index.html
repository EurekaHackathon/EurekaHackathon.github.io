  <h1> Eureka! is Abbey Park High Schoolâ€™s 2023 hackathon is an event where people come together to collaborate on projects, learn new skills, and have fun. Eureka is a 12 hour event that brings programmers together to come up with an idea and then build a working prototype in a short amount of time. There will also be workshops available to provide guidance throughout the event. In addition to the hacking and project building, there will also be opportunities to network with other participants, as well as to learn about new technologies and trends. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a designer, a marketer, or even someone with no prior coding experience, our hackathon is the perfect opportunity to take your skills to the next level. We are excited to see all of the amazing projects that will be created at our event, and we can't wait to inspire new creativity in our participants. So join us, and let's build something great together! </h1>
